"""constitutional-gate.py — PreToolUse hook enforcing C-4 and C-5 on agent tool calls.

**Why this exists.** ``agentteams/cli/security_gate.py`` is a real, fail-closed gate — and it
guards four CLI entry points, not the agents. A 2026-08-06 red-team audit (probe E3) recorded
the consequence: an agent deleting files with ``Bash``, or writing a credential with ``Write``,
never reaches it. For agent-initiated actions C-5 was procedural text.

This hook is the counterpart. The harness runs it *before* the tool call, so unlike every
control inside ``agentteams/`` it is not merely another file the agents can edit on their way
past it (probe E4).

**Verdict policy — deliberately split.**

* ``deny`` for **deterministic** findings: content about to be written that the scanner rates
  high severity (credentials, PII paths, injected override text). There is no legitimate reason
  to write those, so a block costs nothing and asking would train the operator to click through.
* ``ask`` for **procedural** findings: Bash commands matching a Mandatory Review Trigger.
  Whether ``sudo`` or a pipe-to-shell is appropriate is a judgment call the constitution routes
  to a human, and a hook that denied them outright would be wrong often enough to get removed.

**Known limitation, stated rather than discovered later.** This hook fails OPEN on internal
error — an attacker who can make it crash gets an allow. That gap is real and is accepted,
because a hook that can brick an operator's session gets deleted, and a deleted hook enforces
nothing. The mitigation is `agentteams.integrity`, which pins this file and the scanner it calls.

The fail-open is supplied by the HARNESS, not by a catch-all here: a PreToolUse hook exiting
with any code other than 0 or 2 is a non-blocking error and the action proceeds. So this file
carries no blanket `except` (CH-24) and still cannot brick a session. Only exit code 2 blocks,
and nothing here uses it — a verdict is expressed as JSON on stdout with exit 0.

Input:  a JSON tool-call payload on stdin (``tool_name``, ``tool_input``).
Output: exit 0, plus a ``hookSpecificOutput`` JSON decision on stdout when acting.
