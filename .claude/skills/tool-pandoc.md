# Pandoc — CLI Reference — ResearchTeam

> Operational reference for the **Pandoc ** command-line tool in ResearchTeam.
> Pandoc is a tool the team *uses* — not an agent. Configuration and execution
> should follow the procedures below; route security-rule changes through `@security`.

**Tool:** `Pandoc` ``
**Configuration files:** `N/A`

## Official Documentation

Consult the official Pandoc documentation at: {MANUAL:TOOL_DOCS_URL}

Verify CLI flags, configuration options, and rule/plugin behavior against this documentation.

## Config Management

Current configuration lives in: `N/A`

Before any configuration change:
1. Read the current configuration file
2. Verify the proposed change is compatible with ``
3. If the change disables security-related rules or checks, request clearance from `@security`
4. Back up the existing config by saving as `<filename>.backup` before writing
5. Apply the change and verify the tool runs successfully

## Command-Line Usage

1. Run `Pandoc` with the project's standard flags and configuration
2. Capture stdout and stderr
3. Check exit code — non-zero exit indicates findings or errors
4. Parse output to identify actionable items vs informational messages

<!-- AGENTTEAMS:BEGIN output_interpretation v=1 -->
## Output Interpretation

After every execution:
- Categorise findings by severity (error, warning, info)
- Identify auto-fixable issues vs those requiring manual intervention
- For auto-fixable issues, apply the fix and re-run to verify
- Report remaining issues with file paths and line numbers
<!-- AGENTTEAMS:END output_interpretation -->

## Integration

- Pre-commit hooks: verify Pandoc runs on staged files before commit
- CI pipeline: ensure Pandoc runs in CI with the same configuration as local development
- Editor plugins: confirm real-time feedback is configured where supported

## When to Involve the Team

Raise with `@orchestrator` (and `@security` for rule changes) when:
- Pandoc exits with an unexpected error (not a findings report)
- Configuration conflicts with another tool in the project
- Security-related rules need to be disabled
