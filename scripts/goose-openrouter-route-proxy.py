"""Local proxy that injects OpenRouter provider routing into every goose request.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
OpenRouter serves one model id from many upstream backends, and they are not equally
correct. Measured 2026-07-24 against ``qwen/qwen3.6-27b`` by replaying a real captured
agent payload (11 messages, 24 tools, reasoning enabled), 12 trials per backend:

    Alibaba 12/12 ok   CoreWeave 12/12 ok   Morph 12/12 ok
    Chutes  1/12 leak  Phala     1/12 leak  SiliconFlow 3/12 leak

A "leak" is the dead-turn bug: the model emits its tool call as literal
``<tool_call>`` text inside its reasoning stream instead of the structured tool-call
field, so goose sees nothing actionable, the turn ends with ``finish_reason: stop``,
and NO error is logged anywhere. See
``references/plans/goose-openrouter-tool-call-reasoning-leak-2026-07-24.report.md``.

OpenRouter can be told which backends to use -- but **goose 1.37.0 provides no way to
send that**. ``OPENROUTER_PARAMETERS`` in ``config.yaml`` is inert (verified: the key
does not appear in the 1.37.0 binary, and neither a nested ``provider`` block nor a
top-level ``transforms`` override reaches the wire, while a ``model`` change in the
same file does). ``OPENROUTER_HOST`` *is* honored, so this proxy adds the routing at
the transport layer.

Because it sits under ``OPENROUTER_HOST``, it covers **every goose surface** -- CLI,
``goose acp`` (the VS Code extension), and desktop -- unlike a ``goose run`` subprocess
wrapper, which by construction cannot see ACP traffic.

USAGE
-----
    python3 scripts/goose-openrouter-route-proxy.py --port 8791

Then in ``~/.config/goose/config.yaml``::

    OPENROUTER_HOST: http://127.0.0.1:8791

and restart goose (for the VS Code extension: reload the window, so the ``goose acp``
daemons re-read config).

Defaults to an **allowlist** of backends measured clean. Prefer ``--only`` over
``--ignore``: a denylist is only as good as your enumeration of bad backends, and an
incomplete one silently reroutes to whatever is left -- which is how an early version
of this work landed on SiliconFlow, the worst measured offender.

OPERATIONAL COST, STATED PLAINLY
--------------------------------
This is a process that must be running. If it is not, goose has no endpoint and every
request fails. That is a real tradeoff versus tolerating an intermittent dead turn;
it is why nothing here is installed or auto-started for you.

CAVEATS
-------
* "Clean" is bounded, not proven: 0/12 per backend leaves a ~22% upper bound on the
  true leak rate at 95% confidence (~10% pooled across the three). This reduces the
  failure rate; it does not guarantee zero.
* **Confirmed the hard way later the same day: the leak recurred on Morph** -- one of
  the three backends above -- with this proxy verifiably injecting the allowlist. An
  8-run end-to-end test still produced 2 silent dead turns. Treat the table as "these
  were the best of a bad set", not as a list of safe backends.
* Restricting backends can lower the effective context ceiling (Morph advertises 131k
  vs 262k for the others) and reduce availability/price competition.
* Backend behavior is not static, and **no tooling here re-measures it for you**.
  ``scripts/goose-openrouter-preflight.py --providers <model>`` lists the current
  roster (who serves the model, context, quantization) -- useful for spotting that a
  listed backend has disappeared, but it does NOT measure tool-call reliability. That
  still requires replaying a real payload N times per backend by hand; an automated
  ``--measure`` mode is logged as open work in
  ``references/agentteams-remediation-log.csv``.
* ``--only`` sets ``allow_fallbacks: false``, so if every listed backend is delisted
  upstream the request **fails loudly** rather than silently routing somewhere
  unmeasured. That is deliberate -- a silent fallback would defeat the allowlist --
  but it does mean a stale list turns into hard errors, not degraded routing.
* Secrets: the ``Authorization`` header is relayed verbatim and never logged.

IMAGE INTERCEPTION (2026-08-13)
-------------------------------
Standing operator policy: **raw image content never leaves this machine.** Every
``image_url`` content part in a relayed ``/chat/completions`` body is replaced with
locally-extracted text (tesseract OCR plus an OpenCV dominant-color / layout-block
summary) before forwarding — regardless of whether the active model supports vision.
This both enforces the policy and fixes the 404 that motivated it: the active model
(``z-ai/glm-5.2`` since 2026-08-11) is text-only on every backend that serves it, so
any image-bearing turn died with "No endpoints found that support image input".

Requires ``pytesseract``, ``Pillow``, and ``opencv-python-headless``, pinned in the
dedicated venv ``~/.config/goose/ocr-venv`` (the ambient interpreter resolving
``cv2`` via an Anaconda ``$PATH`` entry is an accident, not a dependency). Run the
proxy with that interpreter::

    ~/.config/goose/ocr-venv/bin/python3 scripts/goose-openrouter-route-proxy.py ...

The policy **fails closed** (2026-08-13 security + adversarial review): an image
part that cannot be OCR'd — decode failure, oversize, a remote http(s) URL, an
``input_image``-shaped part — is replaced with a ``[image withheld: ...]`` text
notice, never forwarded raw. Likewise at startup: if the OCR libraries are not
importable the proxy **refuses to start** rather than silently running in a mode
that forwards raw images (and 404s against text-only models anyway). The explicit
escape hatch is ``--allow-raw-images``, which restores verbatim relay of image
parts and prints a warning banner.

    """Assemble the OpenRouter ``provider`` routing object.

    Args:
        only: Backend names to restrict routing to (allowlist).
        ignore: Backend names to exclude (denylist).
        extra: Additional provider-object fields (e.g. ``{"sort": "throughput"}``).
        prefer: Backend names to try first, as ``provider.order``. Added 2026-08-10: an
            unordered ``only`` list lets OpenRouter's own price-sort pick whichever allowed
            backend is cheapest *today*, which silently drifts as prices move (measured:
            this exact allowlist's cheapest member changed twice in four days). "Use
            provider X" needs `order`, not `only`.

            CORRECTED 2026-08-10 (same day, live-verified against the API): OpenRouter does
            NOT treat ``order`` as a preference within ``only`` when ``allow_fallbacks`` is
            false — ``order`` alone becomes the entire candidate set, and anything in
            ``only`` but not in ``order`` is never tried. An initial version of this
            function set ``order`` to ``prefer`` verbatim, which is a hard single-backend
            pin in disguise: when the preferred backend later stops serving a model (as
            happened the same day -- CoreWeave has no endpoint for qwen/qwen3.8-max),
            every request 404s with "No endpoints found", not a fallback. Fixed by
            appending the rest of ``only`` (in its given order) after ``prefer``, so
            ``order`` always lists every allowed backend and ``prefer`` only affects which
            is tried first. Verified against the live API: with
            ``order: [CoreWeave, Alibaba, Z.AI]`` and ``allow_fallbacks: false``, a
            qwen/qwen3.8-max request (Alibaba-only today) succeeds via Alibaba. Also
            verified: bare ``order`` with no ``only`` falls back past an unreachable
            entry on its own (OpenRouter defaults ``allow_fallbacks`` to true there),
            so a ``prefer`` given without ``only`` is passed through as-is.

    Raises:
        ValueError: ``prefer`` names a backend not present in ``only`` (when ``only``
            is non-empty). Silently dropping it could mask a typo the caller believes
            is taking effect; silently keeping it would let an unvetted backend into
            the candidate set, defeating the allowlist the same way the order-only-pin
            bug defeated fallback.
